## Task

A lot of work has been done over the last 10 years to automatically extract objects from satellite images with significative results but no effective operational effects. 

Now Airbus is turning to Kagglers to increase the accuracy and speed of automatic ship detection.

## Evaluation
This competition is evaluated on the F2 Score at different intersection over union (IoU) thresholds.
